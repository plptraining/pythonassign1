# Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. 
# The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. 
# If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.

def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):

        discount_amount = price * (discount_percent / 100)
        return price - discount_amount
    else:
        return price

final_price = calculate_discount(5000, 30)
print(f"Final price: ${final_price}")

# 2.  Using the calculate_discount function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. 
# Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.
